# embed

Embeds a package file into a module constant at build time.

**Term** `insere` · **Section** KEYWORDS

## Syntax

```
const <type> <name> = embed "<path>"
```

## What this teaches

- Build-time embed — `const T X = embed "path"` reads a file while compiling; the program carries its contents as a literal.
- One keyword, two results — the declared type decides: `string` requires valid UTF-8, `bytes` takes the raw bytes.
- Package-relative paths — resolved against the package root (the nearest `faber.toml`), or this file's directory when there is none.

## Common mistakes

- Using an absolute path or `..` to reach outside the package — both are compile errors (SEM061).
- Declaring `string` for a binary file — invalid UTF-8 is a compile error; declare `bytes`.
- Expecting a runtime read — changing the file needs a rebuild; for run-time I/O use a `call` route.

## Grammar

```
fixum_decl  :← 'fixum' type_annotation IDENTIFIER '=' const_init
const_init  :← insere_expr | expression
insere_expr :← 'insere' STRING
```

## Expected output

```
insere.expected — the embedded text, its length, and the byte count.
```

## Example

```fab
const string NUNTIUS = embed "nuntius.txt"

const bytes SIGNUM = embed "signum.bin"

class Tabula {
    static string TITULUS = embed "nuntius.txt"
}

# `embed` is contextual: directly before a string literal it is the embed; any
# other use of the name, like this call, is an ordinary identifier.
fn embed(int n) → int {
    return n * 2
}

main {
    print NUNTIUS
    print NUNTIUS.length()
    print SIGNUM.length()
    print embed(21)
}
```
