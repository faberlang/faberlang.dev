Faber is one language with many compilation contracts. This page is the
**measured lowerability matrix**: for each corpus term, which targets can
lower it, and at what support level.

Policy verbs (support / erase / warn / reject / defer) and pipeline routing
live on [Codegen targets](/tooling/codegen-targets.html). This page is the
large scannable row list — HIR application-lane targets and MIR systems-lane
targets side by side in the tables below.

Live CLI summary: `faber targets`.

**Generated**: 2026-07-22 by `scripta/generate-ebnf-matrix.py` — **do not edit**.
**Measurement**: `emit_hir_target_matrix` + `emit_mir_target_matrix` (in-process, no external toolchains).
**Join**: `examples/corpus/index.toml` terms → exempla.

This is the **official generated** grammar×target support matrix. It reports
**lowerability** — can target X lower grammar production Y — across every term in
the exempla corpus. Runtime semantics (erase/warn/defer policy verbs), per-target
contracts, and pipeline routing live in
[Codegen targets](/tooling/codegen-targets.html), which links here for the rows.

## Legend

| Glyph | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✓ | fully supported — all analyzable exempla for the term lower |
| ◐ | partial — some exempla lower, some have a measured gap |
| ○ | planned — not yet lowering; curated overlay (`scripta/ebnf-matrix-overrides.toml`) |
| ✕ | not supported — no exempla lower; default-truth, measured gap is real |
| — | not measured — no analyzable exempla for this term on this lane |

> A ✓ means the corpus exempla exercising this term lower to the target. It does
> **not** guarantee identical runtime semantics. Some targets *erase* or *warn* on
> certain constructs (e.g. Go erases borrow modes `de`/`in`/`ex`) — those still
> render ✓ here because they lower. See the policy doc for that nuance.
