## Release notes {#notes}

> **Status**: final

Minor product release spanning **253 commits** since `v1.4.0` (2026-07-31).
Headline: **device execution on Apple Metal and NVIDIA CUDA** via
`faber run --backend metal|cuda` — the first real device-execution surface —
supported by hardened install-time pack resolution and the first
**versioned release manifest** with reproducible provenance.

### Major tracks

#### Device execution on Metal and CUDA (the lead)

`faber run --backend <auto|metal|cuda>` (plus the `[device] backend` manifest
key) executes a packaged device program on real GPU drivers. Proven with one
collection kernel — a tree reduction, `summa` — on both named machines:

| Row | before | after | why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `metal-text` run | no | **yes** | `faber run --backend metal` executes device programs on Apple M5 Max (burgus) |
| `llvm-text` run | no | **yes** | `faber run --backend cuda` executes device programs on NVIDIA RTX 5070 (pharos), NVVM→PTX device artifacts |
| `metal-text` / `llvm-text` package | no | no | `package=yes` waits for the Stage 7 archive gate (E6/E7) |

The `-t metal-text` / `-t llvm-text` emit surfaces are unchanged; device
execution is selected by the run backend. Device-capable packages carry an
`@ nucleum` compute kernel; the packaged FMIR image's `device` section carries
the canonical device program, the MSL/PTX artifacts (provenance hashes), the
selection request, and the `device:*` runtime requirements. Fail-before-launch
on real drivers uses stable structured codes: `E_BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE`,
`E_NO_DEVICE_PROGRAM`, `E_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR`, `E_DEVICE_ABI_MISMATCH`,
`E_DEVICE_ENTRY_MISMATCH`, `E_DEVICE_DTYPE_MISMATCH`, `E_DEVICE_SHAPE_MISMATCH`.

The device **prefill** path now runs per-head attention with per-position RoPE
(plus a K-major repack); the Q2 test query reaches a **top-1 PASS on Metal**
(5,188 launches, finite).

**Honest scoping:** this release states *capability*, not accuracy. The
numeric-parity band is **not claimed** — the record is `numeric_matches: false,
ok: false`. Device execution is proven to launch and run on real hardware; the
numeric inference accuracy claim is deferred (see Known limitations).

#### Hardened install-time pack resolution

Installed binaries resolve the reference and locale packs from the install
prefix and **fail closed** on tampered, version-skewed, or stray-checkout
content (E5). Release archives no longer carry baked
`CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` paths. All 8 locale packs resolve
(`ar`, `en`, `hi`, `la`, `th-TH`, `vi`, `zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`).

#### Versioned release manifest + reproducible provenance

The first `release-manifest.yaml` instance pins exact sibling source commits
(radix / cista / faber-runtime / hosts) with reproducible reference-pack
digests — the assembly race is fixed (the radix commit is resolved once, not
per pack). Tag stamping records only real tags, and the validator
hard-fails on unsupported JSON-Schema keywords.

#### Device path hardened; exempla baseline freshened

- **Prefill hygiene:** the device prefill path's panic surface is closed — 2
  documented invariants, 0 panic paths, fail-closed `Diagnostic`s.
- **Exempla e2e floors:** the wasm tier is reconciled to the cursor-stream +
  package-lane proofs.
- **Release-helper interlock:** JSON receipts with a same-digest tamper check
  and leakage-clean receipts, rehearsed green in a worktree dry run.

#### Wasm package lane (U6)

Package-aware Wasm builds — accept, emit per-unit, link manifests, and host
run — with the carrier-typed `importa` fixture through the product
package-to-Wasm builder.

#### Locale: tensor-family surface

The tensor-family locale surface rounds out with a `th-TH` round-trip; the
`la` reader locale is tagged on its packages.

#### Canonical nominal identity and reduced-resource device projection

- Package-crossing nominal types retain canonical identity across analysis
  boundaries, including struct values and enum variants. Missing or
  unresolvable identity-bearing variants fail closed (`b1b6ed4`, `5e96ceb`,
  `2ca42df`).
- Faber emits and admits the wire-8 reduced-resource projection for device
  programs and rejects malformed, degenerate, or unsupported axis-reduction
  projections (`6fe40af`, `5bd30f6`, `9fbcf03`, `93911fc`).
- The diagnostic-language option is consistently named
  `--diagnostics-locale` (`9fd0fa0`).

### Known limitations

- **Cross-module `textus` handles** are limited by separate linear memories at
  the package-wasm boundary — cross-module handle passing does not span
  modules.
- **Numeric inference accuracy is deferred.** The numeric-parity band is not
  claimed; device execution is a capability statement (see Device execution
  above). A numeric accuracy claim may appear in a later release.
- `package=yes` for device programs waits for the Stage 7 archive gate;
  multi-kernel device programs and the persistent training-step lifecycle are
  Stage 2+.

### Deferred to v1.6

Onboarding Stages 4–8 (doctor, portable no-Rust hello, Norma/Triga
acquisition, locale docs parity), the numeric inference accuracy claim, and
full release automation beyond the manifest instance + release-doctor
dry-run. These are not implied anywhere in this release.
