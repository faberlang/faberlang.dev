## Release notes {#notes}

**Status:** authorized source release scope: RC2 is a source tag and GitHub
prerelease only, within Faber's first odd-major development line. This note
makes no binary asset, Homebrew, crates.io, or install-route claim. RC2 is not
a language-lock or LTS gate; see [`policy.md`](policy.md).

### Scope

RC2 covers the Faber CLI source after the RC1 version-alignment commit
`cd24854`, through the validated local head. The package version and lockfile
now both identify `faber` as `1.0.0-rc.2`.

### Faber CLI changes since RC1

- Hardened generated-package dependency and namespace handling: direct runtime
  dependency selection, linked-library namespace metadata, package-path
  containment, duplicate lock-name rejection, and more stable HTTP binding
  probes.
- Hardened verified core-support operation: created cache directories now have
  restrictive permissions, and native-host bootstrap failures remain fallible
  instead of silently degrading.
- Added and tightened the inference-session release checks: exact CLI contract
  fields and target lists, negative contract coverage, diagnostic identities,
  and model-artifact oracle validation.
- Kept generated Cargo/runtime path behavior unchanged while making the test
  support compare filesystem-equivalent paths. This closes macOS `/var` versus
  `/private/var` assertions without changing containment or resolution policy.
- Continued package/compiler hygiene and regression coverage across the Faber
  build, link, archive, and runtime-plan paths.

These bullets describe Faber-repository changes; compiler/runtime implementation
belongs to the companion repositories below and is not silently attributed to
the Faber CLI package.

### Companion release-lane changes

The RC2 local gate also validated the separately versioned companion surfaces at
these local heads:

| Surface | Local head | Scope note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Radix compiler/host | `247d50785` | compiler, host, geometry, macOS carrier validation, and the WGSL diagnostic-prose hygiene fix |
| `faber-runtime` / LLVM host | `b6d1ad3` | runtime behavior and LLVM-host Clippy cleanup |
| Host-kernel | `4e6c657` | kernel carriers |
| Host-native | `d2d7d4d` | current `/Users/ianzepp/work/faberlang/host-native-rs` head; fallible native construction |
| Host providers | `0720a2c` | provider contracts |
| Cista package store | `5bf7a53` | package-store locking and macOS path-test portability |
| Triga geometry/graphics | `bbace0d` | geometry validation and finite-normal ownership fixes |
| Examples corpus | `128a40e` | current GPU-output reference declarations |

These are companion checkout facts, not claims that those repositories are
published as part of the Faber CLI package version.

### Local validation

Run from `/Users/ianzepp/work/faberlang/faber` on 2026-07-14:

```text
cargo metadata --locked --format-version 1
cargo test --all --locked
cargo test --release --locked
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo build --release --locked
target/release/faber --version
```

Observed gates:

- Cargo metadata completed with the `faber` package and lockfile both at
  `1.0.0-rc.2`.
- `cargo test --all --locked`: passed — 336 library unit tests, 372 binary
  unit tests, 2 clean-install tests, 17 emit tests, 4 format tests, 1 hygiene
  test, and 67 run tests; doc tests also passed.
- `cargo test --release --locked`: passed with the same test suites.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`: passed.
- `cargo build --release --locked`: passed.
- `target/release/faber --version`: `faber 1.0.0-rc.2`.

### Release-lane boundary

RC2 validates a development-line candidate. It does not freeze grammar,
semantics, ReaderPacks, standard packages, ABI/wire formats, or package
compatibility. Those contracts remain subject to the `1.x` development line;
the first language-locked LTS gate is planned for Faber 2.

### Limitations and release controls

- RC2 is authorized as a source tag plus GitHub prerelease only. It has no
  binary assets, Homebrew formula, crates.io package, or install-route claim.
- The existing RC1 local-binary evidence remains historical RC1 evidence; it is
  not rewritten as RC2 evidence and its old checksum must not be reused.
- Historical Vivi coordination records may retain RC1 labels or describe
  different intermediate candidate snapshots. Those records are preserved as
  history; this note reports the current checkout, lockfile, companion heads,
  and commands above rather than treating the historical dissonance as a
  release disagreement.
- No binary creation, Homebrew update, crates.io publication, install-claim
  change, or 1.0 release is included.
