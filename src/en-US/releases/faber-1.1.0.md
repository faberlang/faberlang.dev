## Release notes {#notes}

Minor product release spanning **13 commits** since `v1.0.0`
(2026-07-14→2026-07-17). Headline: reader-locale-driven Faber emit surface
(`--reader-locale`), the first tag-driven GitHub Actions release workflow, and
the process/versioning/interdependency analysis docs.

*Era note: this tag predates the current release-note convention (Scale table,
companion pins, recorded verification gates). These notes are reconstructed
post-hoc from the commit range; no pre-release gate records were captured
in-tree for this era.*

### Scale

| Signal | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Commits (no merges) | 13 |
| `feat(...)` commits | 1 |
| `fix(...)` commits | 2 |
| `test(...)` commits | 3 |

Remainder of the range: 4 `docs`, 1 `ci`, 1 `release`, 1 `polish`.

```bash
git log v1.0.0..v1.1.0 --oneline --no-merges

### Major tracks

#### Reader-locale emit surface (`--reader-locale`)

Phase 2 of the reader-locale-emit goal (Radix). The two CLI gates that
suppressed localized output are removed: `faber emit -t faber` no longer
rejects `--reader-locale`, and `faber format` no longer requires
`--canonical`. The reader locale resolves to a pack (Faber owns install-layout
+ package-manifest resolution) and is handed to
`radix::tool::cmd_emit_with_reader_pack`, so `faber emit -t faber
--reader-locale=<X>` emits localized Faber. `--canonical` remains the Latin
alias; no flags keeps author mode.

Phase 3 proves the surface: a new test shows `--reader-locale=ar` emits Arabic
keywords (دالة functio، بداية incipit) in logical codepoint order — no Latin
survives and no Bidi isolates / embedding controls (U+202A–U+202E,
U+2066–U+2069) are injected.

#### Go codegen dispatch adaptation

The radix `generate_from_analyzed` dispatch seam gained a `KeywordSurface`
parameter after reader-locale emit threading. Go is not a localized target, so
the surface is unused; a Latin surface is constructed once per Go package
result and forwarded to keep the build green.

#### First tag-driven release workflow

`.github/workflows/release.yml` lands (b771357): triggers on `vX.Y.Z` tag push
or manual dispatch, builds the `faber` binary for x86_64-linux, x86_64-macos,
and aarch64-macos, validates the crate version against the tag, and publishes
platform archives with SHA-256 checksums to `faberlang/releases` with
faber-prefixed tags. The CI workspace assembles the full `faberlang/` layout
by checking out siblings (radix via `FABERLANG_RELEASES_TOKEN`, cista,
faber-runtime, host-kernel-rs, host-native-rs, host-providers-rs). The hygiene
ratchet is vendored as `crates/hygiene-ratchet/` so Faber is self-contained
for hygiene tests (the cross-repo path dep was a monorepo split leftover).

#### Package resilience

`fix(package)`: fall back from a missing runtime dependency instead of
failing, with new test coverage. A generated-provider loopback test
(`test(http)`) proves the provider codegen round-trip. Artifact-plan helpers
are clarified.

#### Process docs

- `docs(design)`: CLI surface analysis vs Radix + Cista (head-cto) — the
  compile/check/run/test loop is fully covered (14 targets); package
  management is flagged as the main usability gap (by-design repo separation,
  staged per the Cista roadmap); no gap blocks the release-1.1 narrative.
- `docs(release)`: process, versioning, and interdependency analysis
  (head-cpo) across all 10 repos, three release workflows, and version/tag
  drift.
- `docs(release)`: major parity and language lock definition.
- `docs`: faber factory status truth refresh.

### Version alignment

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source tag | `v1.1.0` (annotated, 2026-07-17) |
| `Cargo.toml` package version | `1.1.0` |
| Public artifact tag | **none observed** — no `faber-v1.1.0` on `faberlang/releases`; the earliest published Faber binary is `faber-v1.1.1` |
| Build matrix | Linux x86_64 + macOS x86_64 + macOS arm64 (as configured in the new workflow) |

### Known limitations

- The tag-driven release workflow landed the same day the `v1.1.0` tag was
  cut; CI `cargo build --locked` against sibling default-branch tips was not
  yet reconciled. The same-day `v1.1.1` re-release refreshes `Cargo.lock`
  specifically so the workflow's locked build succeeds (see `v1.1.1.md`).
- No `faber-v1.1.0` public binary was published to `faberlang/releases`.
- No in-tree pre-release verification records exist for this era.
