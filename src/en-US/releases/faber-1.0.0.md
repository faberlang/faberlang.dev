## Release notes {#notes}

**Status:** authorized source release; first coordinated public development
line. Faber `v1.0.0` promotes the verified RC2 source state as an annotated
source tag and GitHub release only. This note makes no binary asset, Homebrew,
crates.io, or install-route claim. It is not an LTS or feature-lock record;
see [`policy.md`](policy.md).

### Promotion

Faber `v1.0.0` promotes verified RC2 commit `9f201942c` and its annotated tag
`v1.0.0-rc.2`. The promotion changes only the Faber package version from
`1.0.0-rc.2` to `1.0.0` in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, and records this
release note. No product changes are included.

### Companion release-lane heads

The promotion preserves the independently validated companion surfaces:

| Surface | Local head | Scope note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Radix compiler/host | `247d50785` | compiler, host, geometry, macOS carrier validation, and WGSL diagnostic-prose hygiene |
| `faber-runtime` / LLVM host | `b6d1ad3` | runtime behavior and LLVM-host Clippy cleanup |
| Host-kernel | `4e6c657` | kernel carriers |
| Host-native | `d2d7d4d20` | current `/Users/ianzepp/work/faberlang/host-native-rs` head; fallible native construction |
| Host providers | `0720a2c` | provider contracts |
| Cista package store | `5bf7a53` | package-store locking and macOS path-test portability |
| Triga geometry/graphics | `bbace0d` | geometry validation and finite-normal ownership fixes |
| Examples corpus | `128a40e` | current GPU-output reference declarations |

These are companion checkout facts, not claims that those repositories are
published as part of the Faber CLI package version.

### Promotion gate evidence

Run from `/Users/ianzepp/work/faberlang/faber` on 2026-07-14:

```text
cargo metadata --locked --format-version 1
cargo test --all --locked
cargo test --release --locked
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo build --release --locked
target/release/faber --version
```

Observed gates:

- Cargo metadata completed with the Faber package at `1.0.0` and the lockfile
  agreeing.
- `cargo test --all --locked`: passed — 336 library unit tests, 372 binary
  unit tests, 2 clean-install tests, 17 emit tests, 4 format tests, 1 hygiene
  test, and 67 run tests; doc tests also passed.
- `cargo test --release --locked`: passed with the same test suites.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`: passed.
- `cargo build --release --locked`: passed.
- `target/release/faber --version`: `faber 1.0.0`.

### Release-lane classification

`v1.0.0` is the first coordinated public Faber release, but it belongs to the
odd-major development lane. The `1.x` line may evolve its grammar, semantics,
ReaderPack surface, standard packages, and other contracts under the release
policy. Faber 2 is the first planned language-locked LTS line; its lock gate
must be evidenced separately and must not be inferred from this release.

### Historical coordination and limitations

Historical Vivi records may retain RC1 labels or describe intermediate
candidate snapshots. Those records remain preserved history; they do not
change the verified RC2 source state, the promotion gate evidence, or the
companion heads recorded here.

The honest `v1.0.0` release surface is the source tag plus GitHub release only.
It includes no binary assets, Homebrew formula, crates.io publication, or
install-route claim.
