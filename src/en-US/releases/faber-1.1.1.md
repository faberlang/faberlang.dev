## Release notes {#notes}

Patch re-release spanning **1 commit** since `v1.1.0` (2026-07-17). Headline:
**CI lock hygiene** — `Cargo.lock` refreshed against current sibling `main`
tips so the tag-driven release workflow's `cargo build --locked` succeeds;
version bumped to `1.1.1` while the `v1.1.0` tag remains as source-tag
history.

*Era note: this tag predates the current release-note convention (companion
pins, recorded verification gates). These notes are reconstructed post-hoc;
the sibling-pin record from `v1.1.1-sibling-pins.md` is folded in below and
that file remains the historical record.*

### The 1.1.1 change

`release: prepare Faber 1.1.1 — lock hygiene for CI path siblings`
(`e6c4af2`):

- Refresh `Cargo.lock` against the current `origin/main` tips of the radix and
  core-support siblings so `cargo build --locked` succeeds in the release
  workflow.
- Record the sibling SHAs at lock refresh in
  `docs/release/v1.1.1-sibling-pins.md` (the historical pin record).
- Bump the package version `1.1.0` → `1.1.1`; the `v1.1.0` tag remains as
  source-tag history.

`v1.1.1` is a re-release of the same source state with a refreshed lockfile;
no product changes are included.

### Sibling pins (CI main tips at lock refresh)

The release workflow checks out each sibling at `main` tip. These SHAs match
the tree used to regenerate `Cargo.lock` for the 1.1.1 release (folded from
`docs/release/v1.1.1-sibling-pins.md`):

| Repo | Full SHA |
| --- | --- |
| radix | `69767af9f87eb88a936906f0fc2fde033dd086e4` |
| faber-runtime | `b6d1ad3ab9ca96772ae9e1cc1390a88fea4c590e` |
| host-kernel-rs | `20a18bee021f575d27203d463360251a0d2f4f25` |
| host-native-rs | `d2d7d4d20c22cd01b472bb166081735ca6d341fd` |
| host-providers-rs | `c0723410661a1126b17a5ab3657d1a9a848c9dac` |
| cista | `0d8e8198e253034f83bf7c2cabbb2d83676a8c25` |

These are documentary facts at lock refresh, not release pins — the faber
release CI checks out siblings at default-branch tips, not at these commits.

### Version alignment

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source tag | `v1.1.1` (annotated, 2026-07-17) |
| `Cargo.toml` package version | `1.1.1` |
| Public artifact tag | `faber-v1.1.1` on `faberlang/releases` (earliest observed Faber public binary) |
| Build matrix | Linux x86_64 + macOS x86_64 + macOS arm64 (per the release workflow at this tag) |

### Known limitations

- The sibling pins are main-tip snapshots, not pinned checkouts; the release
  workflow continued to check out siblings at default-branch tips. The pins
  file itself notes: "If CI main moves and `--locked` breaks again, either pin
  these SHAs in `release.yml` or refresh the lock against new tips and cut a
  patch release."
- No in-tree pre-release verification records exist for this era.
