### Major tracks

#### Cista composition for install/resolve

The product composition law is recorded (`docs(design)`): Faber is the product
seam that composes Radix and Cista; spawn-only separation is retired as
long-term law. Install and library resolution now route through Cista:

- `faber install` for path sources (09f3443) and for git sources (16bb59c —
  temporary checkout, requires `cista.toml`, Cista called in-process) uses the
  package store and project-lock rewrite path; registry pins route through
  Cista (7329a80).
- The legacy `FABER_LIBRARY_HOME` source-library clone path is removed from
  the default surface (remains behind an explicit `--legacy-library-home`);
  the legacy library-home path is removed (11ee45f).
- Store-only library locks are proved (48ff510); the workspace-library probe
  is made opt-in (bf4cf44).
- `faber mir` CLI alias added; install help clarified (4b03c04).
- `feat`: norma http client routed to the runtime; norma `solum fundet` route,
  `norma` json e2e package roundtrip, and rust build covered by tests.

#### Browser product pipeline (DEFER-120)

`faber build` accepts browser product recipes (4243291) and generates browser
static assets (73713d0), a browser controller ESM (ec001c2), controller
lifecycle + browser event ambient types (fc1a0e1, eff801b):

- Product-path registry unifies `faber-ts` / `faber-esm` / `tsconfig` /
  output-filename literals under one source of truth (a052f55, 02f32d8 —
  CXO producer-hole residual 8530ddb7 closed).
- Generated outputs fail closed against static assets and against each other
  (`product_output_collision`); package-qualified origin validation for
  `WebController` / `Scope` rejects local shadowing with
  `product_controller_unqualified_origin` (auditor block_ship closures
  96a8d17, 272ca15, 163db2e).
- Web ambient declarations expand to the full `dom.fab` / `web.fab` export
  surface; controller TS adaptation rewrites `new unresolved_def()` to `{}`
  and drops spurious `: void` closures so WEB5 fixtures type-check under tsc
  (8aec665).
- Regression coverage: `tests/web2_build_integration_test.rs`;
  gap-1/gap-4 tests for missing controller and `unresolved_def` rewrite
  (b9d0c2d); `g10_web3_*` negative tests for local shadowing.
- Merge `07015f9` integrates the DEFER-120 gaps 1+4 branch (test coverage).

#### Compiler pin: Radix 0.77.0

The path-dep pin moves from `0.38.0` → `0.77.0` (release commit 973ac37):

- radix diagnostics peel: `DiagnosticConvert` trait import (3839a49);
  `Diagnostic::io_error` now borrows (449ad33).
- New transitive leaf path-dep locks: `radix-types`, `radix-hir`,
  `radix-codegen-shared`, `radix-codegen-ts` (radix Stage 1C/2/0b extracts).
- Package MIR adapts to the rust-leaf extract: `MirKernelBuiltin` /
  `CliProgram` mapped to radix-codegen-rust surfaces (06cc92f);
  `MirIntrinsic::Gradient` match arm added — A-rail gap (2e924e3); missing
  `shader_stage` field fixed in `mir_test` (d008ed3).
- 61 of 67 post-annotation test failures resolved (806ac7b): explain/reference
  registry assertions 194→195 entries, 178→179 terms; text-contract
  diagnostic-code expectations after reader-locale changes; package tests via
  an unconditional workspace probe. The remaining 6 (`g8_sqlite` ×4,
  `g9_api3_http` ×2) are pre-existing cargo build errors in generated code
  with external runtime deps.

#### FMIR artifact version 3

`MirConstant` gains `UInt(u64)` unsigned constants (modular-word-width family,
R0–R4), shifting postcard variant indexes; text and binary FMIR images move to
artifact version 3 with an exact-match version gate — v2 images reject with
`actual=2, expected=3` and no source fallback. R0 failing proofs land first
(0565523), then the version bump (830b2ed); upper-half u64 constants
round-trip through built images. The corpus gains modulus terms, raising the
canonical term count to 178 and the explain registry entries to 194 (07720d9,
R4); a later fix raises the assertions to 179/195 after the examples corpus
adds an "ergo" term.

#### Hosts-monorepo core-support

Core-support assembly moves to the hosts monorepo crate layout (`hosts/crates`,
18e4514); legacy `host-*-rs` root names are dropped. CI checks out the hosts
monorepo (`mintedgeek/hosts`) instead of the individual host repos (41cf7dc,
866224f), fixing the build.rs "required core-support path is missing" failure.
The private e2e harness relocates from radix into this repo as `crates/exempla`
(workspace member, 634c87b); D-P-02 proof rows are corrected to match
remeasurement with a pre-existing faber compilation fix (1e0f1ce).

#### Hygiene and test ratchet

- Clippy pedantic mechanical fixes across the tree (ad07402, 6b3a0fb, 4e4aa10,
  d26fb0c, ad8ad7f, cb64981); inline library tests extracted under the hygiene
  ratchet (2dff2ef); duplicate test-module path fixed (325a588).
- Large unit-test additions per `docs/factory/test-decomposition-report.md`:
  82 MIR utility tests, 24 Go compile tests, 19 frontmatter tests, 18 discovery
  tests, 17 binding-probe tests, 14 format tests, 13 run tests; missing
  `host:stderr` coverage added (0bbd565).
- Arabic reader-locale emit test flagged `#[ignore]` (pre-existing parse
  error, unrelated to this release's annotation/codegen fixes); hygiene
  budgets ratcheted (expect 1→2, let_underscore 3→8).

#### CI / release workflow

- Release checksum files now write basename-only sha256 files (128c749).
- macOS-13 Intel matrix dropped from the release workflow (unreliable GHA
  queue, 4675843); Linux x86_64 + macOS arm64 remain.

### Companion pins (local path layout)

| Surface | Head / note |
| --- | --- |
| **Radix** | `0.77.0` (local path dep) |
| **Cista** | in-process dependency for install/resolve routing |
| **faber-runtime / hosts** | core-support siblings per `core-support-manifest.txt` (hosts monorepo layout) |

Faber remains a path-composed product CLI; the release workflow checks out
siblings in CI via `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

### Breaking / author-visible

| Change | Migration |
| --- | --- |
| Radix `0.38.0` → `0.77.0` compiler pin (path dep) | Rebuild against the 0.77.0 radix tree; radix annotation/diagnostics API changes apply |
| Legacy `FABER_LIBRARY_HOME` source-library clone path removed from default install | Use Cista-routed installs; `--legacy-library-home` retains the old clone path |
| FMIR artifact version 3 with exact-version gate | v2 FMIR images are rejected (`actual=2, expected=3`) without source fallback |

### Version alignment

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source tag | `v1.2.0` (lightweight tag, 2026-07-22) |
| `Cargo.toml` package version | `1.2.0` |
| Public artifact tag | `faber-v1.2.0` on `faberlang/releases` |
| Build matrix | Linux x86_64 + macOS arm64 (Intel matrix dropped in this range) |

### Known limitations

- 6 pre-existing test failures remained at release: `g8_sqlite` ×4 and
  `g9_api3_http` ×2 — cargo build errors in generated code with external
  runtime deps, not addressed in this release.
- The Arabic reader-locale emit test is `#[ignore]`d (pre-existing parse
  error, deferred for investigation).
- No in-tree pre-release verification records exist for this era (the
  recorded-gates convention starts with v1.3.0).
- The `v1.2.0` tag is a lightweight commit tag (the annotated-tag convention
  starts later).
